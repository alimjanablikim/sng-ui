# ShadNG Skills

ShadNG Skills standardize AI behavior across tools so teams get consistent Angular output quality.

Supported adapters include Codex, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and Cline.

## Why this helps

- Keeps package naming consistent: `@shadng/sng-ui`, `@shadng/sng-icons`.
- Applies the same fallback policy across AI tools.
- Reduces prompt drift in multi-tool teams.

## Usage model

1. Add skill files to your repo/user config.
2. Keep them versioned with code.
3. Update when docs, APIs, or conventions change.

## Combined with MCP

Skills define behavior. MCP provides runtime context.

Together, they improve consistency and delivery speed for real Angular product work.
