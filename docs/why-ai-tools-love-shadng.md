# Why AI Coding Tools Love ShadNG UI

ShadNG UI keeps component logic local and explicit, which makes AI-assisted edits more reliable.

## Why it works

- Components are readable TypeScript files in your project
- Styling is explicit through semantic utilities and tokens
- There is no opaque runtime layer hiding component behavior

## Result

AI tools can inspect, explain, and patch component code with fewer guesses and better consistency.
